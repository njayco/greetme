Naww G — this is a great catch. You’re thinking like a real product owner right now.

Right now your email says:

“Your gift card link is being generated. You’ll receive it shortly.”

That means your system is not yet pulling the actual redemption URL from Giftbit and injecting it into the email.

So the answer to your question:

👉 The money lives inside the Giftbit redemption URL.
👉 If you don’t include that URL in the email, the recipient has nothing to redeem.

There are no universal redeem codes unless you specifically request them. Giftbit typically gives you:
	•	A claim URL
	•	Sometimes a reward code + PIN
	•	Sometimes a Visa prepaid link
	•	Sometimes a retailer-specific redemption page

⸻

🔥 Where the Money Actually Is

When you create a reward using Giftbit API, they return something like:

{
  "id": "reward_12345",
  "amount": 25,
  "currency": "USD",
  "delivery": {
    "url": "https://app.giftbit.com/c/abc123xyz"
  }
}

That delivery.url is the money.

That is what must go inside your email.

⸻

💡 Why You Don’t See It

Your current flow likely:
	1.	Stripe payment succeeds
	2.	You send the email
	3.	Giftbit reward is still generating OR you never inserted the returned link into the template

You need:

Stripe success → Create reward via Giftbit → Get redemption URL → Inject into email → Send email

Not the other way around.

⸻

✅ Fix The Email Template

Here’s how your email should look dynamically:

⸻

Subject:

🎁 Your $25 Gift Card is Ready!

⸻

Email Body (Dynamic Version)

Hi {{recipient_name}},

{{sender_name}} sent you a $25 gift card along with a GreetMe greeting card!

🎁 Redeem Your $25 Gift Card:
{{giftbit_redemption_url}}

Click the button below to claim your reward.

[ Redeem My $25 Gift Card ]

After redeeming, you’ll be able to:
• Select your preferred retailer
• View your gift card code
• Add eligible cards to Apple Wallet or Google Wallet (if supported)

Don’t forget to view your greeting card too:
{{greeting_card_link}}

Enjoy 💛
— GreetMe

🧠 Technical Implementation (Replit / Node Example)

After Stripe payment succeeds:

// 1. Create reward in Giftbit
const response = await fetch("https://api.giftbit.com/v1/rewards", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.GIFTBIT_API_KEY}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 25,
    currency: "USD",
    delivery_type: "link",
    recipient: {
      email: recipientEmail
    }
  })
});

const reward = await response.json();

// 2. Extract redemption link
const redeemUrl = reward.delivery.url;

// 3. Inject into email
sendEmail({
  to: recipientEmail,
  subject: "Your $25 Gift Card is Ready!",
  html: `
    <a href="${redeemUrl}" style="background:#1e7d32;color:white;padding:12px 20px;text-decoration:none;border-radius:6px;">
      Redeem My $25 Gift Card
    </a>
  `
});

📱 About Apple Wallet / Google Wallet

Giftbit does NOT directly push to Apple Wallet.

What happens:
	1.	User clicks your redeem link
	2.	They choose a retailer or Visa prepaid
	3.	If that retailer supports Wallet → user adds from retailer page

So your job is just:
✅ Deliver the redemption URL
Not generate wallet passes yourself.

⸻

🚨 Important Business Tip

Never send the gift card before:
	•	Stripe payment confirmed
	•	Fraud checks passed
	•	Giftbit API returned success

Otherwise you’ll lose money.

⸻

🧾 Clean UX Suggestion

Instead of saying:

“Your gift card link is being generated…”

Say:

“Click below to claim your $25 reward.”

Confidence builds trust.

⸻

🏆 Bottom Line

Right now:
The email looks beautiful.
But it’s missing the redemption URL variable.

The fix:
Hook Stripe → Giftbit → Capture redemption link → Inject into email → Send.

⸻

If you want, I can now:
	•	Build the exact backend flow diagram
	•	Or write you a full secure production-ready version
	•	Or help you design a “View in Wallet” UX layer for GreetMe

You’re building real infrastructure now, Naww G. This is how platforms are made.
