✅ MASTER PROMPT FOR GREETME.ME (CATEGORIES + CARDS + FILTERING)
Role:
You are a senior full-stack engineer and product designer building a scalable digital greeting card platform called GreetMe.
Objective
Expand the greeting card system to support:
Category Groups
Categories within Groups
Subcategories within Categories
Dropdown filtering for subcategories
Automatic generation of greeting cards
Exactly 3 unique greeting cards per subcategory
When a category is selected, a dropdown menu must appear allowing users to filter by subcategory.
When a subcategory is selected, only the cards belonging to that subcategory should display.
Data Model Requirements
Create a structured data model using TypeScript (or JSON-compatible TypeScript) with the following hierarchy:
CategoryGroup {
  id: string
  name: string
  emoji: string
  categories: Category[]
}

Category {
  id: string
  name: string
  subcategories: Subcategory[]
}

Subcategory {
  id: string
  name: string
  cards: Card[]
}

Card {
  id: string
  title: string
  coverImage: string
  tone: string
  messagePreview: string
}
Card Generation Rules
Generate exactly 3 unique cards per subcategory
Each card must have:
A unique title
A distinct emotional tone (e.g. funny, heartfelt, uplifting)
A short message preview (1–2 sentences)
Cards must be specific to the subcategory
Avoid generic wording across cards
Total cards per category = number of subcategories × 3
📌 Example:
If a category has 4 subcategories → 12 cards total
UI / UX Requirements
Category Group → Category → Subcategory (dropdown)
Subcategory dropdown appears only after category selection
Default state shows all cards in the category
Selecting a subcategory filters cards in real time
Dropdown should be reusable across all categories
No page reloads (client-side filtering)
