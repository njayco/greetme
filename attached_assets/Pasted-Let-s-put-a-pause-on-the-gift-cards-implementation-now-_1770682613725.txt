Let’s put a pause on the gift cards implementation now will come back to that later when I can get the API keys right now let’s expand the greet. Me categories and sub categories create at least one card with a unique cover and a unique greeting that matches each category and sub category This is exactly the kind of taxonomy work that turns GreetMe.me from “a card site” into a real platform.

Below is a clean, scalable, implementation-ready category system you can drop straight into your database or CMS. I’ll structure it so it works for:
	•	browsing
	•	SEO
	•	future expansion
	•	filtering (holiday, zodiac, tone, relationship, etc.)
