Here’s a **revised, tighter Replit prompt** that focuses specifically on making the **saved signature render at the bottom of the BACK page** (not the centerfold), with the **printed sender name under it**, and keeping everything consistent with your current GreetMe structure.

```text
You are working inside my existing GreetMe digital greeting card app (Next.js/React). I already added a Signature feature during card creation (draw/upload + saved signatureUrl). Now I need you to PLAN + IMPLEMENT the FINAL RENDERING so the signature appears at the BOTTOM of the BACK page of the card (not under the personal note in the centerfold).

CONTEXT
- The card has tabs/steps: Cover, Centerfold, Back.
- The Back page currently shows a “From / To” style layout (and/or a small back message area).
- I want the saved signature image + printed sender name to render at the very bottom of the Back page, inside the white card area, aligned like a real signature.

GOALS
1) Rendering location:
   - Signature must appear ONLY on the Back page view (the “Back” tab/section/page).
   - Place it at the bottom of the white card panel (visually pinned to the bottom), not floating mid-content.
   - Do NOT place it on Centerfold.

2) Visual layout:
   - Signature block should be aligned right by default (like signing a card).
   - Signature image max width: 220px (responsive on mobile), keep aspect ratio.
   - Printed name under the signature (e.g., “Najee Jeremiah” or the Sender name), slightly smaller than normal text.
   - Add spacing so it looks clean:
     - ~16–24px padding from bottom of the card
     - ~8px gap between signature image and printed name

3) Data:
   - Use signatureUrl from the card model.
   - Printed name should come from the sender name field already in the card (ex: senderName / fromName). If there isn’t a dedicated senderName field, create one and ensure it’s saved (it already exists in UI as “From:” so reuse that value).
   - If no signatureUrl, show nothing (don’t leave empty boxes).

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
A) Find the Back page component/layout:
   - Identify the React component that renders the Back page (Back tab).
   - Ensure the Back page container is a flex column so we can pin signature to bottom:
       - Outer card content: display:flex; flex-direction:column; height:100%;
       - Content area above can grow (flex:1)
       - Signature block goes at the end and sits at bottom.

B) Add a SignatureBlock component (recommended):
   - components/SignatureBlock.tsx
   - Props: signatureUrl?: string | null, printedName?: string
   - Renders:
       - <img src={signatureUrl} … />
       - <div>{printedName}</div>
   - Only render if signatureUrl exists.

C) Styling rules:
   - Use Tailwind if project uses it; otherwise use existing CSS modules.
   - Ensure it doesn’t overflow the card.
   - Works on iOS Safari + Android Chrome.

D) Checklist / QA:
   - Test with: signatureUrl present + senderName present -> shows signature at bottom-right with printed name under.
   - Test with: signatureUrl missing -> nothing shows.
   - Test on mobile: the signature scales down and remains anchored at bottom.
   - Test on different card lengths: the signature stays at bottom even if the back message content is short/long.

DELIVERABLES
- A short PLAN first (where you’ll add code, how you’ll anchor it, what fields you’ll use).
- Then implement code changes.
- After implementation, tell me:
  - Which file controls the Back page rendering
  - How to test it in the UI (exact steps)
  - Any edge cases you handled

IMPORTANT
- Reuse my existing “From” name (sender) instead of asking for a new field unless it truly doesn’t exist.
- Do not change the overall look of the card—just add the signature block at the bottom of the Back page.
```

If you want, I can also rewrite this prompt to match your **exact file names/components** once you paste (or screenshot) the file tree around the card renderer (like `CardViewer.tsx`, `CardPreview.tsx`, `BackPage.tsx`, etc.).
