You are my senior Next.js security + build engineer.

Context:
- The Security & Privacy Scanner reports outdated/vulnerable deps:
  - next@15.2.4 -> 15.0.5 / 15.0.8 / 14.2.34 (weird because these are downgrades)
  - glob@10.4.5 -> 11.1.0
- However, my project is already running on Next.js 15.5.12 and compiles fine.
- The agent claims next@15.2.4 and glob@10.4.5 are not present in the current lockfile; likely the scanner is reading stale cached state or an old lockfile/nested dependency reference.

Goal:
Make the scanner findings go away in a clean, reproducible way (not just “works on my machine”), and document exactly what changed.

Instructions:
1) First, prove or disprove the scanner’s claim with hard evidence.
   - Search for the exact strings "next@15.2.4", "glob@10.4.5", "next@14.2.34", "next@15.0.5", "next@15.0.8" across:
     - package.json
     - package-lock.json / pnpm-lock.yaml / yarn.lock (whichever exists)
     - any .replit / build cache / deployment config files
   - Print the command output and file paths where matches occur (if any).

2) Identify which package manager is actually in use (npm/pnpm/yarn) and enforce ONE.
   - If multiple lockfiles exist, pick the correct one and delete the others.
   - Ensure the install command used by the platform matches the chosen lockfile.

3) Do a fully clean dependency rebuild to eliminate stale cache problems:
   - Remove node_modules
   - Remove the lockfile (only the active one) and regenerate it from scratch
   - Clear platform caches if applicable (e.g., .next, .turbo, any .cache folders)
   - Reinstall with a deterministic command (e.g., npm ci if lockfile is trusted; otherwise npm install to regenerate)
   - Re-run: `npm audit --production` (or pnpm/yarn equivalent) and show results.

4) Pin/override any nested vulnerable dependency if it truly exists:
   - If glob is found as a transitive dependency, identify the parent package pulling it in (`npm ls glob` / `pnpm why glob` / `yarn why glob`)
   - Upgrade the parent package if possible.
   - If needed, add an override:
     - npm: "overrides"
     - pnpm: "pnpm.overrides"
     - yarn: "resolutions"
   - Only do overrides if you can confirm the vulnerable version is actually installed.

5) Next.js handling:
   - Do NOT downgrade Next.js. Keep it at the latest compatible stable version already working (currently 15.5.12).
   - Confirm with `npm ls next` (or equivalent) that only one Next version is installed.
   - If multiple Next versions exist, dedupe / resolve.

6) Validation:
   - Run `npm run build` and `npm run start` (or `next build` / `next start`) and confirm no runtime errors.
   - Re-run the platform’s Security & Privacy scan (or explain exactly what to click / rerun).
   - Provide a concise final report:
     - root cause (stale cache vs actual nested dep)
     - commands run
     - files changed
     - before/after versions
     - how to prevent recurrence.

Output format:
- Start with “Findings” (evidence from searches and dependency tree)
- Then “Fix applied” (steps + diffs)
- Then “Verification” (audit/build/run results)
- Then “Prevention” (1–3 bullets)
